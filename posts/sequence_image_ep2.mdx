In the previous part, we explored how sequence images operate under the hood. In this episode, we will try to implement it.

## Strategy

There are 2 approaches to archive, one is use scrollsequence WordPress Plugin and the other is code it by ourselves. I opted for the latter approach as it's more engaging :3 :3.

About the javascript animation library, we have 3 different options:

- **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)** : This is the first choice when it comes to handling animation. GSAP is lightweight library and being used for advanced applications, games and animations.

- **ScrollMagic Image Sequence** : ScrollMagic is an extension for GSAP. Although there are some online tutorials on how to use it, its performance and support are somewhat lacking. While it was a viable option previously, ScrollTrigger has now outperformed ScrollMagic in various aspects.
- **JQuery Sequencer** : Based on the research I have conducted, this appears to be a simple approach, although I have not yet tested it.

I decided to choose **ReactJS** with **GSAP** library on this blogs for its performance and familiarity.

## Lets go

By modeling and rendering on C4D, i have a set of 18 different 3d images. [You can get all here for data preparation](https://google.com)

![data preparation](/images/sequence_image_ep2/data-prepare.PNG)

Firstly, we define canvas tag in jsx render

```
 return <canvas ref = {canvas} >

```

Then, we need to preload all images in advance.

```
const preloadImage = () => {
  let imgls = [...Array(19).keys()].map(x=>{
      const image = new Image();
      image.width = 3000;
      image.height = 840;
      image.src = require(`../../assets/images/Transparent Silicon Sequence Img/sil${x}.png`);
      return image;
  })
  return imgls;
};
```

Create render function, this function will trigger canvas to draw image when being called.

```
    const context = canvas.current.getContext('2d');
    const render = () => {
      context.clearRect (offsetX,offsetY,nwidth,windowDimensions.height*0.8);
      context.drawImage(imagelist[id], offsetX,offsetY,nwidth,windowDimensions.height*0.8);
    };

```

Before using GSAP to apply changes, we declare 2 necessary variables:

```
  const imgUrl = {index: 0}; //this is the object where gsap making change to index property according to the scroll position.
  let id = 1; //this is actually index of which image is painted in canvas.
```

finally, we register gsap to create animation that updates the index property of an object (imgUrl) and calls a render function on every frame while the animation is active.

```
 useEffect(()=>{

    const width = window.document.body.clientWidth;
    const height = window.innerHeight;
    setWindowDimensions({width : width,height : height})
    const nwidth =  windowDimensions.height*0.8*3000/840;
    const offsetX = (windowDimensions.width - nwidth) / 2 ;
    const offsetY =  0;
    const imgUrl = {index: 0};
    const context = canvas.current.getContext('2d');
    let requestId ;

    const render = () => {
      context.clearRect (offsetX,offsetY,nwidth,windowDimensions.height*0.8);
      context.drawImage(imagelist[id], offsetX,offsetY,nwidth,windowDimensions.height*0.8);
    };
    imagelist[0].onload = render
    //console.log(windowDimensions)
    gsap.to(imgUrl, {
      // backgroundPosition: (-offset_value * frame_count * 2) + "px 50%",
      // ease: "steps(" + frame_count + ")", // use a stepped ease for the sprite sheet
      index: 18,
      scrollTrigger: {
      start: 2*windowDimensions.height,
      end: "+=" + windowDimensions.height,
      scrub: 1 ,
      },
      onUpdate: self => {
        const round = Math.round(imgUrl.index);
        if (round !== id){
        id = round;
        requestId = window.requestAnimationFrame(render);}
     }})
```
