My project required carousel for particular feature. I didn't want to use heavy library for this small task. Following research, i was captivated by how the carousel work and decided to implement it on my own.

## What is infinite carousel?

Carousel are typically utilized to present content in a grid format that can be scrolled to accommodate certain content within a specified dimension. It will improve user experiences by giving user 2 options to choose : scroll vertical view different contents or scroll horizontal to view more items of that contents (or vice versa). This is particularly good on mobile app for its limited space.

Infinite carousel is the carousel that can be loop infinity. it means when you scroll to the last item on the list, the next item should be the first item again.

I believe the concept of "infinite" is not inherently difficult to grasp. The challenge lies in representing this "infinite" concept in our code and displaying it to the user. If you think what we do is just looping through an array, do we need to generate an endless list of items? How can we fit an infinite list of items into a finite memory space?

The answer is No, we have to do some trick to deceive user vision instead.

## Infinite carousel under the hood

The main point of this method is to secretly take an "alpha jump" when user reach edge of the list. To archive this, we have to make each edge of list look alike by adding some "clone" items to both edges.

For instance, consider a list of 5 items, where only 1 items are visible in the viewing area at a time. What happen when we click next?

As i have mentioned above, we will add some "clone" items to make the ends correspond.

When user reach the end, we will take an "alpha jump" to the first, and the loop continues again.

Similarly, when user reach the start edge and continue to scroll, we will jump forward to the end edge.

As you have witnessed, with a simple trick, we've managed to make the seemingly impossible, possible. That is the reason i love coding and want to bring algorithmns into every aspects of my life ^^
